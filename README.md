INTRODUCTION
============

Perl module for TrueType/OpenType font hacking. Supports reading, processing and
writing of the following tables: GDEF, GPOS, GSUB, LTSH, OS/2, PCLT,
bsln, cmap, cvt, fdsc, feat, fpgm, glyf, hdmx, head, hhea, hmtx, kern,
loca, maxp, mort, name, post, prep, prop, vhea, vmtx and the reading and
writing of all other table types.

In short, you can do almost anything with a standard TrueType font with
this module. Be Brave!

Any suggestions, improvements, additions, subclasses, etc. would be gratefully
received and probably included in a future release. Please send them to me.

This module has been tested on Win32, Unix and Mac.

Applications that were associated with this module have been moved to
Font::TTF::Scripts where great things can be done.

SYNOPSIS
========

Here is the regression test (you provide your own font). Run it once and then
again on the output of the first run. There should be no differences between
the outputs of the two runs.

    use Font::TTF::Font;

    $f = Font::TTF::Font->open($ARGV[0]);

    # force a read of all the tables
    $f->tables_do(sub { $_[0]->read; });

    # force read of all glyphs (use read_dat to use lots of memory!)
    # $f->{'loca'}->glyphs_do(sub { $_[0]->read; });
    $f->{'loca'}->glyphs_do(sub { $_[0]->read_dat; });
    # NB. no need to $g->update since $_[0]->{'glyf'}->out will do it for us

    $f->out($ARGV[1]);
    $f->DESTROY;               # forces close of $in and maybe memory reclaim!

INSTALLATION
============

If you have received this package as part of an Activestate PPM style .zip file
then type

    ppm install Font-TTF.ppd

Otherwise.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

    perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install Font::TTF somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

    make

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

    make install

To tidy up, type:

    make realclean

Windows users should use dmake instead of make.
